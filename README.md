# Javascript Minesweeper

A re-creation of the classic game "Minesweeper" using Javascript.

Click [here](https://rkclark.github.io/minesweeper/) to have a go! *Recommended to open in Chrome, other browsers untested!*

## Notes

The app will auto-size the game grid to your current screen size. Click the cog in the top left to customise the size as well as change the difficulty.

The number of mines your game contains is random generated and based on the difficulty level selected.

On touch-screen devices, tap any square to uncover it. Tap and hold to mark it as a mine.

## Development Notes

This is a "for fun" project that I created to practice a few different languages and tools. It uses:

- Bootstrap 4 (Alpha) with Flexbox
- Javascript / Jquery
- Sass
- Gulp for Sass compiling and minification of css and js files
